## User Experience


## Developer Experience

Provided front end code (although I manipulated the styling a bit), and asked to develop the back end code in regards to creating a server.js, webmanifest, serviceworker, and db.js. Creating a site with offline capabilities is expansive in that the user can interact with the site at all times and rely on their data being stored once they have gone back online. This creates a more seemless experience for the user, free of interuptions and setbacks. As a developer, integrating these types of features when possible should be routine.
